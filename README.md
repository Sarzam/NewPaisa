# Tax Assistant Chrome Extension Architecture

## Core Components

### 1. Frontend Interface

- **Popup UI**: The main extension interface that appears when users click the extension icon
- **Form Overlay**: Elements that can be injected into tax websites to assist with form completion
- **Dashboard**: Comprehensive view of the user's tax situation, deductions, and recommendations

### 2. Backend Services

- **Document Processing API**: Cloud-based service for OCR and document understanding
- **Tax Logic Engine**: Core algorithms for calculations, deduction identification, and error detection
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted storage for sensitive financial information

### 3. Integration Points

- **Tax Website Connectors**: Scripts to interact with popular tax filing websites
- **Financial Account Integrations**: Optional connections to banking and financial accounts
- **Document Upload System**: Interface for uploading and processing tax documents

## Data Flow

1. User uploads or provides access to tax documents
2. Extension processes documents and extracts relevant information
3. Tax logic engine analyzes data, identifies deductions, and checks for errors
4. Results are presented to user through the extension interface
5. Extension assists with form completion on tax websites

## Security Considerations

- All financial data stored with end-to-end encryption
- Processing happens locally when possible to minimize data transmission
- Clear privacy policy and data handling practices
- Option for users to delete all stored data
